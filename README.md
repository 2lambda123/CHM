The Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) is a novel modular unstructured mesh based approach. It can move between spatial scale, temporal scale, and spatial extents. It is designed for developing and testing process representations for hydrological models.

Details on how to use CHM can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Chrismarsh/CHM/wiki)
