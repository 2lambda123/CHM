Welcome to Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM)'s documentation!
=============================================================

The Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) uses a novel, modular, mesh-based
approach for developing and testing process representations in
hydrological modelling. It can move between spatial scales, temporal
scales, and spatial extents. Its key features include the abilities to
i) capture spatial heterogeneity in surface discretizations in an
efficient manner, ii) include multiple process representations; iii)
change, remove, and decouple hydrological process algorithms, iv) work
both with spatially localized (point) and non-localized (distributed)
models, v) span multiple spatial extents and scales, and vi) utilize a
variety of forcing fields for boundary and initial conditions. 

The paper describing CHM can be found `here <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/13/225/2020/gmd-13-225-2020.html>`__.
