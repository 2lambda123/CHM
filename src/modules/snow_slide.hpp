 * \class snow_slide
 *
 * SnowSlide is a simple topographically-driven model that simulates the effects of gravitational snow transport.
 * It uses a snow holding depth that decreases exponentially with increasing slope angle, limiting snow accumulation
 * in steep terrain. The algorithm moves mass from the highest triangle of the mesh to the lowest one. If the snow
 * depth exceeds the snow holding capacity for a given triangle, excess snow is redistributed to the lower adjacent
 * triangles, proportionally to the elevation difference between the neighboring triangles and the original one.
 * SnowSlide uses the total elevation (snow depth plus surface elevation) to operate. In this study, the default
 * formulation of the snow holding depth proposed by Bernhardt and Schulz (2010) is used which leads to a maximal
 * snow thickness (taken perpendicular to the slope) of 3.08 m, 1.11 m, 0.45 m, and 0.15 m for slopes of 30째 45째, 60째,
 * and 75째, respectively.
 *
 * In the manuscript it is unclear if the holding capacity (max depth) is parameterized for a snow thickness normal to
 * the slope (i.e., how the snowmodels treat snow) or if it is in the vertical direction (i.e., how LiDAR would
 * measure it, a.k.a cosine corrected snow depth). An analysis versus observed LiDAR derived snowdepths over the
 * Kananaskis, Canada domain as well as data observed by Sommer et al. (2015) showed a better evaluation with snowdepths
 * if it is assumed the parameterization is defined for snowdepths in the vertical.
