 *
 * Computes incoming shortwave direct and diffuse beam radiation using a cloud fraction.
 *
 * **Depends:**
 * - Cloud fraction "cloud_frac" (-)
 * - Solar elevation "solar_el" (degrees)
 *
 * **Provides:**
 * - Shortwave direct beam without slope correction "iswr_direct_no_slope" \f$[W \cdot m^{-2}\f$]
 * - Shortwave diffuse beam without slope correction  "iswr_diffuse_no_slope" \f$[W \cdot m^{-2}\f$]
 * - Atmospheric transmittance, [0,1] "atm_trans" [-]
 *
 * **Configuration:**
 * - None
